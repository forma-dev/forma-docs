## Connecting to Forma
When you head to [Modularium](https://modularium.art/) or the [Bridge](https://bridge.forma.art/), click "Connect Wallet" and you should automatically see a prompt to add the Forma network.

If not, you can manually add the network to your wallet. Forma network details can be found on Chainlist here:
https://chainlist.org/chain/984122

Leap Wallet now supports Forma chain natively, no need to add the network manually. Just download Leap Wallet, head over to the “switch chain” button, and search Forma to access your Forma assets.
