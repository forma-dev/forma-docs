## Connecting to Forma

On [Modularium](https://modularium.art/) or the [Bridge](https://bridge.forma.art/), click "Connect Wallet" and you should automatically see a prompt to add the Forma network.

If not, you can manually add the network to your wallet. Forma network details can be found on [Chainlist](https://chainlist.org/chain/984122) or above under Chain Info.

Additionally, Leap Wallet now supports Forma chain natively so no need to add the network manually. Just download Leap Wallet, head over to the “switch chain” button, and search Forma to access your Forma assets.
