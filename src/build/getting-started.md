# Getting Started ðŸ¦£

This quickstart is for web developers who want to start building decentralized applications (dApps) using Forma. It makes no assumptions about your prior experience with Ethereum, Arbitrum, or Solidity. Familiarity with Javascript and yarn is expected. If you're new to EVM, consider studying the Ethereum documentation before proceeding.

## Forma Workshop 

Below our resident wizard, [codecrafting](https://x.com/mycodecrafting), demos Forma's SDK, deploys an ERC-721 contract, and builds a simple NFT minting front-end. This video was used for the ongoing Mammothon hackathon hosted by Celestia but will still be valuable to those looking to build.
