# FAQ

## What is Forma?
Forma is a blockchain purpose-built for onchain creations, built on Astria with Celestia underneath. We have implemented custom EVM precompiles that imbue NFTs with expressivity and enable novel use cases.

We are working on completing and publishing documentation. In the meantime, we worked with Astria to publish a detailed article on how Forma uses Astria and why Forma not just another EVM.

## Who can build on Forma?
Anyone! We will be launching Forma with fully onchain metadata that is readable and actionable from any smart contract. 

This allows for creations to be natively:

◽️Composable
◽️Dynamic
◽️Interactive
◽️Modular

Forma will initially be in closed beta for creators, with curated collections launching in a regular cadence.

## What is the native token of Forma?
Forma will also be the first rollup on Celestia with TIA as the native gas token and currency.

## How do I withdraw my TIA back to Celestia?
Visit the [Forma Bridge](https://bridge.forma.art/), click "Withdraw" and then fill out all fields to withdraw your TIA to Stride. From there, you can use your Cosmos wallet, or one of our bridge partners listed below, to transfer your TIA from Stride to Celestia. 

For example on Keplr, you would find your TIA on the Stride network in your available balance, select send, select the toggle to select IBC Transfer and then select Celestia.

In the future, we plan to enable direct withdraws to Celestia.
