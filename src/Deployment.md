# Getting Started

This quickstart is for web developers who want to start building decentralized applications (dApps) using Forma. It makes no assumptions about your prior experience with Ethereum, Arbitrum, or Solidity. Familiarity with Javascript and yarn is expected. If you're new to EVM, consider studying the Ethereum documentation before proceeding.
